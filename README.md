üí° **Observations:**  

- mmWave configuration (.cfg) inside **mmWaveConfig.h** file;
- If using V-LD3 eval kit, then R220 needs to be removed. This is to avoid bus conflict between FTDI TX line and ESP32 TX line;
- Use the same TX and RX pins on the RMV board that were previously used for the K-LD7.
- Gate application

## üñ•Ô∏è  Viewer Communication

- Baud Rate: 921600 bps
- Data Format: 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit (8N1)
- Port: USB (mapped as a virtual COM port on the host system)

## üì§ JSON Output Format ‚Äî Gate Application

This document describes the structure of the JSON frames sent by the radar gate system running on ESP32S3.
Each JSON message is serialized in a single line and terminated with a carriage return and newline (\r\n).
This makes it easier to parse over serial/UART or network streams where line-based processing is expected.

Example output (actual data in one line):

```json
{"frame":{"dt":100,"n":1167},"zones":{"z1":0,"z2":0,"z3":0},"targets":[{"id":2,"x":-0.519,"y":0.734,"z":0,"vx":-1.271,"vy":-1.143,"vz":0.001,"ax":0.062,"ay":-0.023,"az":0,"cf":0.989,"gf":3}]}\r\n
```
‚ö†Ô∏è No indentation or pretty-printing is applied. This keeps the message compact and suitable for streaming environments.

Each frame corresponds to a parsed radar data packet and includes:

- Timestamp and frame number
- Detection zone states
- Tracked targets (with position, velocity, acceleration, classification)
- *(Optional)* Detected point cloud (to be added)
- The json is transmitted as a single line ended with "\r\n"
